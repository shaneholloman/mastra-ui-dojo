# UI Dojo

A Mastra showcase demonstrating how to integrate Mastra with popular AI UI frameworks. Compare implementations side-by-side and choose the best approach for your project.

## Overview

This project provides working examples of Mastra integrated with three major AI UI frameworks, plus demonstrations of advanced patterns like generative UIs, workflows, and agent networks. Use this as a reference to understand how Mastra works with different UI approaches and pick the one that fits your needs.

## Features

- **Framework Comparisons**: See Mastra working with AI SDK, Assistant UI, and CopilotKit
- **Generative UIs**: Build custom UI components for tool responses
- **Workflows**: Implement multi-step AI workflows with streaming
- **Agent Networks**: Coordinate multiple AI agents for complex tasks
- **Client SDK Integration**: Use Mastra's Client SDK with different frameworks

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mastra-ai/ui-dojo.git
   cd ui-dojo
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API key
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   This runs both the Mastra server and Vite dev server concurrently.

## What's Inside

### Chat Examples

Compare three different approaches to building chat interfaces with Mastra:

- **AI SDK** (`src/demos/ai-sdk.tsx`) - Built with Vercel's AI SDK and `@mastra/ai-sdk`
- **Assistant UI** (`src/demos/assistant-ui.tsx`) - Built with Assistant UI's Thread components
- **CopilotKit** (`src/demos/copilot-kit.tsx`) - Built with CopilotKit's Chat component

### Advanced Patterns

Explore advanced Mastra capabilities:

- **Generative UIs** (`src/demos/ai-sdk/generative-user-interfaces.tsx`) - Custom UI components for tool responses
- **Workflows** (`src/demos/ai-sdk/workflow.tsx`) - Multi-step workflows with the activities workflow
- **Agent Networks** (`src/demos/ai-sdk/network.tsx`) - Multiple agents coordinating through a routing agent

### Client SDK Integration

See how to use Mastra's Client SDK with each framework:

- **AI SDK + Client SDK** (`src/demos/client-sdk/ai-sdk.tsx`)
- **Assistant UI + Client SDK** (`src/demos/client-sdk/assistant-ui.tsx`)
- **CopilotKit + Client SDK** (`src/demos/client-sdk/copilot-kit.tsx`)

## Architecture

### Agents (`src/mastra/agents/`)

Example agents demonstrating different capabilities:

- **Weather Agent** - Provides weather information using external tools
- **Ghibli Agent** - Studio Ghibli themed responses with image generation
- **Routing Agent** - Coordinates between multiple specialized agents
- **Background Color Agent** - Demonstrates UI manipulation through tools

### Tools (`src/mastra/tools/`)

- **Weather Tool** - Fetches weather data for locations
- **Ghibli Tool** - Generates Studio Ghibli style images
- **Color Change Tool** - Updates UI background colors

### Workflows (`src/mastra/workflows/`)

- **Activities Workflow** - Multi-step workflow for planning activities based on weather

## Common Issues

### "OPENAI_API_KEY is not set"

- Make sure you've created a `.env` file from `.env.example`
- Verify your API key is valid and properly formatted
- Restart the dev server after setting environment variables

### "Port already in use"

- Check if another Mastra or Vite process is running
- Kill the process or change the port in `vite.config.ts`

### "Agent not responding"

- Check the browser console and terminal for errors
- Verify your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
- Ensure the Mastra server is running (check `http://localhost:4111`)

## Development

### Commands

- `pnpm run dev` - Start both Mastra and Vite servers
- `pnpm run mastra:dev` - Start only Mastra server
- `pnpm run vite:dev` - Start only Vite dev server
- `pnpm run vite:build` - Build for production
- `pnpm run lint` - Lint code
- `pnpm run format` - Format code with Prettier

### Customization

Modify the agents, tools, and workflows in `src/mastra/` to experiment with different capabilities. Each demo can be found in `src/demos/` and uses components from `src/components/`.
